## tl;dr
App that is inspired by yelp!, yamu or other rating services, except this app rates places, people and services that are safe and non discriminatory  towards LGBTQ+ communities and other discriminated minorities

## Description
Created specifically for use in Sri Lanka, but can be used in other locales as well, it is designed to be all inclusive hub of safety for people of difference and discriminated minorities
